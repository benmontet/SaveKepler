\section{Executive summary}

\section{Philosophy and motivation}

Image modeling will deliver many bits; we will get more science per
downloaded pixel than the naive predictions of degradation.

Kepler core goals remain outrageously interesting.

We know a lot about the prevalance of planets and the stars in which
we could possibly detect them; we should use this to reduce our data
volume.

TESS is coming; we can help with that.

Asteroseismology and transit timing variations both benefit from
shorter cadence.
